# Screenotate 2.0 has moved to <https://screenotate.com>!

[Screenotate](https://screenotate.com) is a macOS tool for taking
screenshots you can search: screenshots taken in Screenotate go
through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to make any text inside
searchable, and they include context like the source URL, application,
and window title.

You can download and purchase the updated version of Screenotate at
[screenotate.com](https://screenotate.com).

Compared to Screenotate 1.x, the new version includes:
- a newer version of Tesseract (the OCR engine)
- more extensive screenshot tools (capturing a whole window, for
example) 
- support for viewing and searching old screenshots in a new popup view.
